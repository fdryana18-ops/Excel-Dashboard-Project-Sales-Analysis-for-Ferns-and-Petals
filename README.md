Excel Dashboard Project Sales Analysis for Ferns and Petals
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze sales data from Ferns and Petals, an online gifting platform. The objective is to showcase key analytics skills essential for data analysts or business analysts, including data extraction, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization—all using Excel’s advanced tools.

Tools and Techniques Used

Power Query Editor: Used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations—importing data from files, cleaning nulls, transforming columns (e.g., extracting months, days, hours), merging tables via joins, and loading cleaned data into Excel.

Power Pivot: An Excel add-in used for data modeling, allowing relationships between multiple tables (fact and dimension tables) to be established. The project adopts a star schema where the Orders table acts as the fact table linked to Customers and Products dimension tables.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized in Power Pivot to create calculated columns and measures such as revenue (price × quantity) and extracting weekday names.

Pivot Tables & Charts: Employed for data analysis and visualization, including bar charts, line charts, and slicers for interactivity.

Dashboard Creation: Consolidates key insights into a clean, user-friendly interface with visualizations for revenue by occasion, monthly sales, top products, city-wise orders, and customer behavior patterns.

Interactivity: Slicers and timelines enable dynamic filtering of data across multiple visuals, enhancing user experience.

Correlation Analysis: Statistical function in Excel is used to explore relationships, such as between order quantity and delivery time.

Executive Summary: Generated using AI tools like ChatGPT to document insights, recommendations, and project overview, which can be included in the GitHub repository alongside the dashboard.
